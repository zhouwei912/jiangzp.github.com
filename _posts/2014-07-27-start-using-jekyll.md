{% include JB/setup %}

I start logging my tech adventures on GitHub. As the first step, we setup my Jekyll blog system.

## Setup Jekyll

The original Jekyll is complex, that all the text should be written in marked language. 

I use Jekyll-Bootstrap instead.

Follow the [Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), and you can setup in 3min.

After that, we can start write now.
